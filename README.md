## Code
The code for this application is mainly written in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. While the front-end will use these languages, the back-end will be sustained with Python (as of now).

## About Me
Hey there! I'm just a 14 year-old working to get better at development of software and web applications. I started coding at a young age and probably went through dozens of languages before finding the one that I liked the most: Python. But I still enjoyed using web development languages as well. That's why I decided on a project like this, which used the power of both. If you want to contact me, send me a Discord friend request at IPSDSILVA.py#1849.
